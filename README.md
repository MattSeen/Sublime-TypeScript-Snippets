# Sublime-TypeScript-Snippets

These are a collection of code snippets that I use with Sublime Text 3. I recommend using the plugin [Better TypeScript](https://github.com/lavrton/sublime-better-typescript), in conjunction with these snippets as the language source might not work with others.

# TypeScript Compatiability

Compatiable with TypeScript 0.9.0-1

# Install

To install checkout this repository into your Sublime Packages directory, which can be found by going to the sublime Preferences menu and clicking on "Browse Packages".

If you don't have a "User" directory there I would advise creating one under which you should checkout the directory. Feel free to checkout it out under a different file name.

## Example

git clone https://github.com/MattSeen/Sublime-TypeScript-Snippets.git TypeScript
